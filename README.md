## Introduction

Accidents are a significant concern on roads, and timely rescue can save lives. This IoT-based automatic accident detection and rescue system uses sensors to detect accidents and automatically sends alerts with precise location details to emergency services and contacts.

## Features

- **Accident Detection:** Utilizes sensors to detect a collision and determine if an accident has occurred.
- **Automatic Alert System:** Sends automated alerts to predefined contacts and emergency services with the accidentâ€™s location and other relevant details.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the vehicle's status and provides real-time updates.
- **Location Tracking:** Uses GPS to track the exact location of the accident.

## Technologies Used

- Arduino
- GPS Module
- GSM Module
- Accelerometer/Gyroscope (e.g., MPU-6050)
- Sensors (e.g., vibration sensor)
- IoT Platforms (e.g., ThingsBoard, MQTT)
- Programming Languages: C/C++, Python

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/syedissambukhari/IoT-Based-Automatic-Accident-Detection-And-Rescue-system.git
    ```

2. **Hardware Setup:**

    - Connect the Arduino, GPS module, GSM module, and sensors according to the provided circuit diagram and code.

3. **Software Setup:**

    - Install the necessary Arduino libraries for GPS, GSM, and sensors.
    - Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
    - Configure the GSM module with your SIM card details.
    - Upload the code to the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. **Configure Contacts:**

    - Edit the Arduino code to include the phone numbers or email addresses of emergency contacts.

2. **Deploy the System:**

    - Install the system in a vehicle, ensuring all connections are secure and the GPS and GSM modules have a clear signal.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**

    - The system will automatically detect accidents and send alerts to the configured contacts with location details.
